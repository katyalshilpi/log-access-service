# log-access-service

log-access-service exposes an endpoint /logs which streams the logs back without any blocking requests.

LoggeratorAccessor reads the loggerator properties form the resource file and based on that establishes connection with it. It reads the logs line by line and
filters them by based on the code/method/user parameters and sorts them by date descending. This is then returned back to the service and returned.

The controller uses the StreamingResponseBody type for async request processing and content is written directly to the response OutputStream without holding up
the threads in the servlet container.

The current memory bottleneck could be the list that stores the filtered log objects. We need to improve this by paginating or applying other strategies to hold
specific amount of data in memory, return that back and repeat the process again.

The loggerator runs on port 8080 and the log-access-service runs on port 18080.

### Simplifying Assumptions

The current implementation assumes that there will be a single value passed in the request parameters and it currently does not support comma-separated multiple
parameter values

### The Logs

The logs we ask you to consume in this challenge are sent from `loggerator` and are HTTP access logs.

For reference, check out this link https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Config/Logging.html.

Here is an example of what output may look like:

### The Configuration

During development, it is possible (and likely a good idea) to change the behavior of the `loggerator`. You can do this by using flags:

`$ docker run gcr.io/hiring-278615/loggerator --help`.

1. **count** - Default: 800000, the amount of logs to be sent over the connection
2. **port** - Default: 8080, the port used by TCP server to send HTTPD logs
3. **seed** - Default: 1, the seed used to coerce log output deterministically

For example, `$ docker run -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/hiring-278615/loggerator --count 15 --seed 3`

### The Challenge

We ask that you write a program (or programs), in any programming language, capable of the following:

- must connect to `loggerator`; receive logs sent over the connection
- must have HTTP REST endpoint called `/logs` that allows a user to search logs sent over from `loggerator`; this endpoint must support the following query
  parameters and return a filtered subset of logs received
  - `code`, e.g. (`code=503`)
  - `method`, e.g. (`method=GET`)
  - `user`, e.g. (`user=randybishop`)
- must return logs in descending order by date, when any permutation of `/logs` is requested

For example, assume the logs your program receive are the ones above (from the section **The Logs**). Let's imagine a user chooses to `curl` your program.

`$ curl <YOUR_SERVER>/logs?user=annstewart&method=POST`

```json
[
  "23.59.50.157 - annstewart [18/Jul/2000 02:12:31 +0000] \"POST /photos/90 HTTP/1.0\" 500 97"
  "23.59.50.157 - annstewart [08/Jul/2000 08:08:53 +0000] \"POST /bookmarks/123 HTTP/1.0\" 200 562"
]
```

**NOTE** Please treat this as an opportunity to show off and let see how you would write something that you'd be proud of! There is no one "correct" answer.

### Your Solution

We are expecting that you send us the source code of a fully implemented solution for the proposed challenge **using the default configurations**
of `loggerator`.

Your code should build and run on a Mac (or GNU/Linux machine) running a recent OS. **Containerized solutions are mandatory** and should be runnable via Docker.

Third party libraries are permitted; however, as our intent is to come to understand your design choices, we ask for a short description of your rationale of
your choices.

### Before submitting your code

**IMPORTANT**: To help keep code reviews anonymous, please be sure to remove any sensitive information about yourself from your deliverable.

**We expect you to make sure that your solution works with `loggerator` before sending it to us**. In order to test that your implementation works, be sure you
have the server you've written running and listening to port 8080, then run:

```
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/hiring-278615/loggerator --count 10
```

This will start the process and begin listening for connections on which to send logs. Once all logs have been sent, the connection will be closed.

```bash
2020/02/05 11:09:44 listening on port 8080
2020/02/05 11:09:56 74716754 bytes written to &{{0xc0001d6080}}
```

### Acceptance Criteria

We expect you to write **code you would consider production-ready**. This can mean a variety of things, but most importantly we look for code to be
well-factored, follow good practices and be tested.

What we will look for:

- Does your code fulfill the requirement and successfully run against the `loggerator`?
- How quickly does the `/logs` endpoint return queries? Are they correct?
- How clean is your design? How easy is it to understand, maintain or extend your code?
- How did you verify your software, if by automated tests or by other means? How much application code is covered?
- What kind of documentation did you ship with your code?
- How cleanly assembled is your container?
